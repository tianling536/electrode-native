The Electrode Native container is a native library similar to common third-party libraries that Android and iOS developers are familiar with. The container is generated entirely by the Electrode Native platform and packaged as a versioned Android Archive (AAR) library for Android and as a framework for iOS.

Each mobile application has its own custom Electrode Native container.
