Even though the [Electrode Native Bridge] is a standalone native module that can be used in your React Native projects (even without Electrode Native), if you are using Electrode Native, you do not directly interact with the Electrode Native bridge in your MiniApps or in your mobile applications. Instead, you'll mostly use Electrode Native APIs that are interacting with the bridge on their own. The Electrode Native APIs are generated from a Swagger schema--so they are predefined. Check out our [Electrode Native API documentation](https://native.electrode.io/reference/index-5).
