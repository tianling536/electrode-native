The Electrode Native local CLI client is installed automatically by the Electrode Native platform when you run the `ern platform install` command.

When you issue Electrode Native CLI commands, you use the local client.
You can have multiple local client versions on your workstation as each Electrode Native platform version that you install on your system will have it's own version of the Electrode Native CLI installed.
Only a single version of an Electrode Native CLI can be active at any given time.
You can switch between versions of the local client using the `ern platform use` command.
