## `ern bundlestore create`

**This command can only be used with access to an [Electrode Native bundle store server]**

**To use this command, the `bundleStore` config must be set in cauldron**

### Description

Create a new store in the bundle store server

### Syntax

`ern bundlestore create <storeName>`

#### Arguments

`<storeName>`

The name of the store to create.
This name is also used as a unique identifier for the store, therefore the command will fail in case a store with a similar name already exist in the bundle store server.

#### Remarks

Upon successful completion of this command :

- The current store will be set to this store (i.e any subsequent `bundlestore` commands will target this store). It is possible at any time to switch to a different store, using the [bundlestore use] command.

- The `store access key` will be logged. This key should be shared with users that will upload bundles to the store. The [bundlestore use] and [bundlestore delete] commands need this access key to operate.

#### Example

- `ern bundlestore create mystore`

Creates a new store with name `mystore`

_Output:_

```
ℹ Store mystore was successfuly created
ℹ AccessKey : d49fd6a7-4957-42df-953b-8ac3a98e7cf8
```
