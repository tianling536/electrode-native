#### Syntax

`ern create-plugin-config <plugin>`

#### Remarks

- This command needs to be run from the root of a cloned Manifest repository
- This command only creates the configuration in the manifest locally. You will need to manually review/test and then git add/commit/push the changes to the Manifest repository.
- This command will fail in case it detects that the plugin should be configurable as it doesn't support Configurable Plugin config generation.
