#### Syntax

`ern publish-container`  

**Options**  

`--containerPath`

* The local file system path to the directory containing the Container to publish.
* **Default**  If this option is not provided, the command will look for a Container in the default platform directory `~/.ern/containergen/out/[platform]`.

`--platform`

* Specify the native platform of the target Container to publish (`android` or `ios`)
* This option is required, there is no default.

`--version/-v`

* Specify the Container version to use for publication.
* The version must be in the format: `x.y.z` where x, y and z are integers. For example `version=1.2.30`.
* Defaults to `1.0.0`.

`--publisher/-p`

* Specify the Container publisher to use.
* This option is required, there is no default.
* You can also use a local file system path to a Container publisher package (only used for developing custom publishers)

`--url/-u`

* The url to publish the Container to 
* Some publishers might not need an url. Check the specific Container publisher documentation for reference

`--extra/-e`

* Extra configuration specific to the publisher used.
* Some publishers might not need an extra configuration. Check the Container publisher documentation for reference.
* There is three different ways to provide the json extra configuration :
  - **As a json string**  
  For example `--extra '{"configKey": "configValue"}'`    
  - **As a file path**  
  For example `--extra /Users/username/my-publisher-config.json`  
  In that case, the configuration will be read from the file.  
  - **As a Cauldron file path**  
  For example `--extra cauldron://config/publishers/my-publisher-config.json`  
  In that case, the configuration will be read from the file stored in Cauldron.   
  For this way to work, the file must exist in Cauldron (you can add a file to the cauldron by using the [ern cauldron add file] command). 

`--inPlace`

* Run the publisher directly from the container directory instead of a temporary directory
* Defaults to `false`
